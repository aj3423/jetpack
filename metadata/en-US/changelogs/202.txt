New: 
 - RecentApps: individual duration for each app
 - "Contact Group" mode in regex rule, making it easy to block all contacts in a group at once instead of blocking them individually 
 - Context menu item "Delete duplicated rules"
Fix:
 - UI frozen due to super long regex
 - rule count indicator in "delete all(%d) rules" never get updated
