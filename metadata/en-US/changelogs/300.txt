Breaking:
- no longer support "export backup as json format"
- New permissions:
  - INTERNET: for downloading spam database, you can [disable it](https://github.com/aj3423/SpamBlocker/issues/147) if you don't use this feature.
  - MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE(Android 11+) or READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE(Android 10), for automated file operations, such as "backup" or "import .csv".

New:
- Spam Database. It's compatible with any public data sources, such as the [FTC - DNC](ftc.gov/policy-notices/open-government/data-sets/do-not-call-data)
- Automated workflow. Use cases:
  - Download spam numbers from public database everyday.
  - Clean up expired numbers in database.
  - Auto backup, auto switch configuration, auto import csv/xml, etc.
- Regex contact mode. The regex will match the contact name instead of the phone number
- language support: pt-rBR, ja

Fix: 
- The history cleanup task is not applied after backup-import
