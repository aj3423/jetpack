New: 
  - adapt android 15, changes:
    - the top bar no longer shows green/red to indicate enabled or not
  - "Delete All Rules" context menu item

Fix:
  - no more ghost process that always redirects to the sms app

Enhancement:
 - testing now works with RepeatedCall, it also checks local db(only when testing)
 - red indicator for swiping left
 - Import rules from csv:
   - use filename as description
   - show warning when the .csv doesn't contain the required column "pattern", to prevent empty rows
